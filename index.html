<th>Features of Lossless Compression</th>
<th>Features of Lossy Compression</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All the original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed</td>
<td>Some of the data is permanently removed during compression and cannot be recovered</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Used with text as all data must be recoverable</td>
<td>Provide more compression than lossless techniques</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example techniques run-length encoding, dictionary encoding</td>
<td>Popular in situations where the removal of data is not noticeable as in the case of images and audio</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example file formats .zip, .png</td>
<td>Example file formats .jpg, .gif, .mp3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not normally applied to video as higher compression rates are needed to make files smaller</td>
